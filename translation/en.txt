[00:05.26] Radio waves are speeding up—I'm totally electrified!
[00:13.26] 
[00:14.26] Things you want to forget, things that make you sad
[00:18.85] I wonder if there is.
[00:20.96] Crying over a movie you don't even know is just because it lacks drama.
[00:36.96] You're always thinking about such silly, trivial things.
[00:28.12] When the rain stops, love and that profile will surely belong to someone else.
[00:34.99] 
[00:47.99] All that fake foundation too
[00:41.63] For tonight
[00:44.35] But why on earth?
[00:45.84] 
[00:49.48] Unstable lantern, how far will you go?
[00:52.83] You've thrown everything away already
[00:59.83] This is no joke.
[00:55.82] Tokyo Shandy Rendezvous
[00:57.94] When the time comes, it won't make a damn thing
[00:59.70] 
[01:03.78] Ambiguous truths only lead to melancholy
[01:07.87] Come on, snatch me up and take me now
[01:16.87] 
[01:17.43] Ugh, nothing but ridiculous rules.
[01:19.34] Not even the slightest bit tempted
[01:20.82] Emotions without substance Even if you just leave them be
[01:23.01] There's no such thing as strategy, so why
[01:25.79] Oh, I'm sick and tired of it!
[01:26.91] My temper, which usually snaps me to attention, held back and put on a brave face until it finally reached its breaking point.
[01:41.91] Year-round lip service and insensitive remarks are utterly tiresome.
[01:31.73] Clang-clang-clang! Feel Girl is a demon even to tearful eyes
[01:35.37] Now, because of the music in my head, I can't make out a single word you're saying.
[01:38.25] 
[01:42.62] Say something sensible for once.
[01:48.12] Spinning turntable
[01:44.82] Hey, let me forget it all.
[01:46.48] 
[01:48.99] But how on earth? Why?
[01:52.50] The flickering lamp won't go out
[01:56.03] You're already at odds with yourself over a single bite.
[02:03.03] This is no joke.
[01:59.06] Tokyo Shandy Rendezvous
[02:01.26] When the time comes, it won't do you any good.
[02:02.99] 
[02:06.92] Ambiguous truths only lead to melancholy
[02:11.08] Right now
[02:13.58] 
[02:29.38] This is no joke.
[02:31.56] Tokyo Shandy Rendezvous
[02:33.23] When the time comes, it won't make a damn thing
[02:37.03] I'm such a disappointment.
[02:38.44] Feelings? Just wash them away at the laundromat.
[02:41.27] Confirm it with me, Yellow Magic
[02:50.27] A-ya-ya
[02:44.25] Tokyo Shandy Rendezvous
[02:45.59] When the time comes, it won't do you any good.
[02:47.28] 
[02:51.23] Ambiguous truths only lead to melancholy
[02:55.36] Come on, snatch me up and take me now
